### The problem

You buy some groceries and house supplies from Walmart. Right after your card swipes, a $230 transaction appears on your banking app, labled 'Groceries'. "That's not right", you say, "The other $50 were supplies for the bathrooms."

You arrive home and start divvying up the expense with your roommates. It takes some calculation because Jeff doesn't want to be part of the coffee beans and milk purchase. Jeff is annoying, but he brings free food time to time, so whatever.

You look back at your banking app - a notification reads that you are getting close to your monthly budget, and in fact, have exceeded your grocery limit. You know that's not true. You know you only spent $80 from that purchase. You know only $35.89 of it is groceries. **Your banking app is useless.**

### The solution is not a spreadsheet, it's Nedon.

#### Nedon plans to offer/offers the following key features:

- Transactions with multiple categories
- Transactions with multiple contributors
- Visualize available budget vs. essential budget
- Receipt recognition
- Family/group spending management
- Budget limits, including roll-over budgets
- And more!

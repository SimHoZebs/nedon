The project is extremely early in development, but a preview build is available on https://nedon.vercel.app

# Problems the project aims to solve

### 1. Splitting transaction categories

Nobody just shops for groceries on a Walmart visit. However, most finance apps categorize this transaction in a single category. Sure, they allow you to manually split it, but it’s not user-friendly or simply annoying.

With Nedon, this is automatic. Simply link it to your e-receipt emails/messages, or upload an image of the physical receipt! **Nedon’s algorithm/AI will read it and generate the additional categories for you**. You can also manually choose the additional categories.

### 2. Splitting with other users

You eat out with your friend and want to split the amount. Or perhaps you don’t care to split it, you just want to keep track of how much you spent on them (are they really worth your $45 this month?) Maybe you have roommates sharing living expenses and you want to make sure everyone's contributing fairly.

Nedon allows you to assign portions of spending to any arbitrary user or with a whole group! This will reflect on your total spending records, correcting that $110 dinner down to what it should be. The amount split with others is tracked and can be found in the respective user profile or group profile. You can send them an automatic text message, or if they have a Nedon account, notify them within the app!

### 3. Financial planning

So many apps claim to help you manage your finance, but what have they actually done? Sure, they let you keep track of your past spending and organize them. You can set monthly budgets too, but come on - when I say $100 monthly budget for gifts, I don’t mean to spend $100 every month, I want that to roll over to the next month. On top of that, none of them actually provide easy tools to visualize trends, abnormalities, and future prospects. Not Nedon.

(Write about interest/investment management, performance review, trend analysis, budget rollovers, etc.)

### 4. Group spending management
